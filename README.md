## Nature's Palette RC 0.1A
Nature's pallete is  currently in an alpha state. Current features include
* Ability to upload files
* Files are validated server-side and client-side
* Search functionality exists but is limited to a single query

## Accessing the webpage
The webpage can be found at http://sc-2.cs.mun.ca/
However, if the Node server running on Excalibur is down, the page will not be reachable.

To run the server locally:
 1. Clone the repo to a directory.
 2. Open a terminal window in your computer.
 3. Navigate to "src" folder inside of the cloned directory. 
 4. Run the command "npm install" inside of the terminal window.
 5. Run the command "node app" inside of the terminal window.
The server will then be accessible locally via the url: http://localhost:3332/
