A github repo for a university course on Software Engineering

***

## Accessing the webpage
The webpage can be found at http://sc-2.cs.mun.ca/
However, if the Node server running on Excalibur is down, the page will not be reachable.

To run the server locally:
 1. Clone the repo to a directory.
 2. Open a terminal window.
 3. Navigate to "src" folder inside of the cloned directory. 
 4. Run the command "npm install" inside of the terminal window.
 5. Run the command "node app" inside of the terminal window.
The server will then be accessible locally via the url: http://localhost:3332/

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 has the following requirements:

* Provide a Vision document
* Identify the relevant use cases and provide a brief description for them. Create a use case diagram for your system.
* Provide a detailed description for three essential use cases.
* Identify the main conceptual classes, their attributes and associations between them (Domain Modelling)
* Identify the entity, boundary and control objects in your diagrams.
* Map use cases to objects with sequence diagrams (show how the behavior of a use case (or scenario) is distributed among its participating objects).
* Identify and address design goals
* Decompose the system
* Decide about the logical architecture (e.g. layering)
* Set up your work environment (Eclipse, Git, â€¦)
* As a warm up to web application programming, create a simple (single) webpage, in which you add a new file (with a brief description) to a list. Each time, the updated list will be displayed in the browser window. Deploy the web page on the departmental server. Provide a url to your page.
